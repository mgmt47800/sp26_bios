# All About Us
The purpose of this repository is to practice collaborating with multiple contributors to a single GitHub repository.

## Instructions
### 1. **CLONE** this repository to your local computer
This will bring a copy of the repository as it exists to your local computer. You can see all the files, edits, and commit history after cloning

### 2. **CREATE** a new branch
Using Visual Studio Code, create a new branch with your *Purdue username* as the branch name.

For example, my branch would be named **ree**

### 3. **DUPLICATE** the _template.md file and edit
Using the template file provided, create a copy named **_username_**.md (using your Purdue username as the filename).

Edit the file and add the requested content.

### 4. **UPDATE** the `README.md` file to create a link to your file
Use the provided example below to add your name to the list of students and link to your `"username".md` file.

### 5. **COMMIT** and **PUSH**
Make a commit with a meaningful commit message and push *your newly created branch* to GitHub.

### 6. **CREATE A PULL REQUEST**
In the GitHub user interface, create a pull request. This notifies the owner of the repository that you would like to "pull" your changes into the `main` branch

### 7. **STOP**
The demonstration will continue in class.
